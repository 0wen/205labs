# The Cloud9 IDE

Nowadays everything is on the cloud. This includes your integrated development environment (IDE). In this module we'll use [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) as our platform to learn web development. Compared with traditional IDEs such as [Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/) cloud-based tools such as C9 offers the following advantages, among many others:

* Minimized maintenance efforts.
* Better access your code, virtually from everywhere.
* Easier to share and collaborate.

> As a programmer we don't share photos like most others do, we share codes instead. This is because [talk is cheap, show me the code](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).

But the drawback is obvious -- you need to be connected. So my advice is KEEP BACKING UP!

### Create (and delete) a workspace

Visit https://c9.io and create an account if you haven't got one. After signing in you should see something similar to this

This is called Dashboard, and it's where different workspaces (projects) are being managed. Click on the plus sign to create a new workspace and name it lab1. Select HTML5 as the template and click Create workspace

This will bring you to something similar to below

Congratulations! You've just created a first project in C9!
